SECTION: 	IGME 105.01 (MWF 8:00 am - 9:50 am)
THEME:		Fitness Tracking
REASON:		I use an app on my phone to track daily activities
		so that I can improve my health, and I thought it would
		be fun to play on the idea that it could be more of a hassle
		than it already is to track your health data.

|==============================FORM DESCRIPTIONS==============================|
HealthForm:
DESC:	Pops up when the program is first run and has some unique (and annoying
	) features.
IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS:
	Organization of form is intentionally gross and unorganized.

	Comic sans.

	The Weight and Activity Level combo boxes must have something selected
	before the user can click "CONFIRM." These combo boxes also show
	the "Birthday" group box when they are changed.
	Weight is also from 12 pounds (lightest adult human ever record) to
	1400 pounds (heaviest). The user must scroll through all weights to
	find theirs. 

	Inside the "Birthday" group box, when the user changes Month or Day,
	the group box becomes hidden. To show it, the user must change Weight
	or Activity Level.

	If the year is between 1946-1964, a message box pops up saying "OK
	BOOMER." If the year is any more than 1900, the form won't let you
	continue. (Essentially, you must be dead to continue)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
StartPage:
DESC:	The main form - pops up after HealthForm is completed.
IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS:
	Buttons are intentionally hard to read and set up a tic-tac-toe board.

	Comic sans.

	[X][O] buttons in the top left allow you to play tic-tac-toe. If you
	win in any way, the form goes into "epilepsy mode" and changes
	background colors infinitely. There's no way to disable this, and the
	user is forced to live with the option. The buttons disappear if the
	mode gets enabled.

	If the header is hovered over it will change colors.

	If the Save Log button is pressed, it will pop up with an error message
	and tell the user to read the file for more information. When the user
	reads the error file, the user will only find a Lenny Face.

	Log Workout opens another form to "log workouts."

	Log Food opens another form to "log foods."

	Quit actually quits the form due to the lack of controls boxes - this
	is a sure fire way to close out the program (intentionally designed
	with this in mind).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WorkoutLog:
DESC:	Allows the user to "log workouts."
IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS:
	Comic sans:
	
	Check boxes work in reverse. Checking the boxes will do nothing. Once
	the check boxes are un-checked, the sections will appear, but if
	checked again, the sections disappear.

	Carries over epilepsy mode from the main form.
	
	Submit hides the form.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FoodLog:
DESC:	Allows the user to "log food information."
IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS:
	Comic sans:

	The Caloric Goal group box hides itself once a radio button is enabled
	(it assumes the user selected it right the first time).

	Carries over epilepsy mode from the main form.

	The Submit button will hide the form IF the following conditions are
	met:
		- All calorie boxes must be filled out
		- A radio button must have been selected
	Otherwise, the submit button shows a SpongeBob meme to mock the user
		- "Hey pal, you just blow in from stupid town?"
